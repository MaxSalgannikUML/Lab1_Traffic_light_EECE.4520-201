Written by Max Salgannik, Phine Kim, Yolmorakatpanhcharong Lim
Description: This arduino (C/C++) code allows a MEGA2560 from ELEGOO control LEDS to simulate a traffic light by having the colors change from red, green, and yellow. when the system is powered on with the uploaded code, the red LED is initialy blinking on/off every 1 second until a user presses the button *The button must be pressed for a second*. Once the button is pressed it begins the change light function that keeps looping until the system is turned off.
How To: Download code from the repository and open Arduino. Open the file and verify. To use this code, one must first build the circuit following the schematic and picture given, and then upload the code to the MEGA2560 via USB cable. Once that is done, the red LED will begin flashing and the traffic light controller is ready to begin.
